==============
In this work, a process to convert Coal to Natural Gas Liquids and mixed alcohols was designed and optimization approachs to convert it into different Natural gas liquids was developed. 

A mathematical program is constructed in LINGO to optimize the necessary conditions to produce a maximum of a particular compoment.

This was a part of my work submitted to Texas A&M University.
