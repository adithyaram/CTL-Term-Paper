abstract = "Abstract This paper analyzes the technical and economic feasibility of the integration of Fischer–Tropsch process based Coal to Liquid (CTL) plants with Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies (CCS). \{CTL\} plants could be multipurpose, and for this reason, starting from coal can produce different energy products like liquid fuels, such as diesel and gasoline, chemicals, electricity and hydrogen. Different plant configurations are possible especially in the case of integration with \{CCS\} technologies. Obviously, the choice of the optimal process configuration is one that better meets technical and economical requirements. In order to make a first assessment, a screening of suitable technologies has been made. The \{CTL\} facility study here proposed is based on commercial coal gasification and Fischer–Tropsch technologies. The system configuration selected and the plant performance has been evaluated using Aspen Plus software. The plant size considered is about 10,000&#xa0;bbl/d of liquid fuel products, equivalent to a consumption of about 4500&#xa0;ton/d of coal fed to the gasification island. The declared objective is to evaluate the potential of the identified plant and to perform a first economic evaluation. The ultimate goal is to determine the specific cost of produced liquid fuels and to evaluate the economic performance of the system. The economic analysis was done to estimate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the payback period and the net present value for configurations with \{CCS\} or without \{CO2\} capture. Results shows that the \{CCS\} introduction in \{CTL\} plants has a lighter impact on plant costs and performance since \{CO2\} capture it is already included in the base plant."

The types of reactor used are discussed with emphasis on the advantages of using the Sasol Advanced Synthol (SAS) reactor. A reactor replacement project at Secunda, South Africa will result in a total installed capacity of 124&#xa0;000 barrel per day of products from the new \{SAS\} reactors. The preparation of the catalyst used in these reactors is described. The changes to the catalyst structure during synthesis are illustrated, making it clear that the actual catalyst consists of small carbide/magnetite particles embedded in a continuous carbon phase. The changes in catalyst morphology which occur during synthesis are discussed with reference to the effect on the observed post sulphur poisoning behaviour. The \{SAS\} process can be considered to be a mature technology which has been applied in large-scale commercial plants. Future applications should take advantage of the considerable potential to recover chemical feedstocks from the primary Synthol products. The potential amounts of these chemical feedstocks are quantified. "

abstract = "A laboratory combustor was used to investigate the factors that influence the conversion of fuel nitrogen in coal during coal combustion. Fuel \{NO\} was isolated by experimentation utilizing Argon/Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide mixtures as the oxidant, and care was taken to compare cases with air at matched conditions. For both well mixed and slowly mixed flame types, fuel \{NO\} contributed over 75% of the total \{NO\} emissions for all conditions examined. Fuel \{NO\} was insensitive to temperature changes except when the adiabatic flame temperatures were above 2480°K (4000°F). At the highest adiabatic flame temperature, 2580°K (4200°F), a 10% increase in fuel \{NO\} was observed. Four different coals and one coal char were investigated. Fuel \{NO\} could not be correlated with fuel nitrogen content alone, even though aerodynamic conditions were kept constant. Fuel nitrogen conversion to \{NO\} during pulverized char combustion was 12–16% at a stoichiometric ratio of 1.15 compared to 28% for a pulverized coal of the same nitrogen content. Furthermore, in contrast to the coal results, \{NO\} emissions from char combustion were not greatly influenced by changes in injector design. The implication is that although conversion of fuel nitrogen to \{NO\} may be relatively low during the char burnout regime of coal combustion, the residual “char NO” may be especially resistant to abatement by modifications of the burner aerodynamics.
